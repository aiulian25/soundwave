## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Elasticsearch Version Update (v9.0.0)

As of February 2026, SoundWave uses **Elasticsearch 9.0.0**. If you're upgrading from a previous installation that used Elasticsearch 8.x:

- **New installations**: No action needed, just follow the Quick Start guide.
- **Existing installations with ES 8.x data**: Your data will be automatically upgraded on first start with ES 9.x.
- **Downgrade warning**: If you previously ran ES 9.x and try to use ES 8.x, it will fail because Lucene index formats are not backwards compatible. Always ensure your docker-compose uses ES 9.0.0 or later.

If you encounter Elasticsearch startup errors mentioning "Lucene912 codec not found", update your `docker-compose.yml` to use `elasticsearch:9.0.0` or delete the ES volume to start fresh:
```bash
docker compose down
docker volume rm soundwave_es_data  # Warning: this deletes search index data
docker compose up -d
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Step 1: Download Files

```bash
# Create a directory for SoundWave
mkdir soundwave && cd soundwave

# Download docker-compose.yml
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aiulian25/soundwave/main/docker-compose.prod.yml -O docker-compose.yml
```

### Step 2: Create Data Directories

**Important:** Docker needs these directories to exist with proper permissions before starting.

```bash
# Create directories
mkdir -p ./audio ./cache ./data

# Set permissions for container user (1000:1000)
sudo chown -R 1000:1000 ./audio ./cache ./data
```

Or use the setup script:
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aiulian25/soundwave/main/setup-dirs.sh
chmod +x setup-dirs.sh
./setup-dirs.sh
```

### Step 3: Create Environment File (Optional)

```bash
cat > .env << EOF
SW_HOST=http://localhost:8889
SW_USERNAME=admin
SW_PASSWORD=soundwave
ELASTIC_PASSWORD=soundwave
REDIS_HOST=soundwave-redis
TZ=UTC
EOF
```

### Step 4: Start SoundWave

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### Step 5: Access the Application

- **URL:** http://localhost:8889
- **Username:** admin
- **Password:** soundwave

Wait ~30-60 seconds for all services to initialize on first start.

# Re-run directory setup
sudo chown -R 1000:1000 ./audio ./cache ./data
```

### Container Won't Start

```bash
# Check logs
docker compose logs soundwave

# Check ElasticSearch
docker compose logs soundwave-es

# Restart services
docker compose restart
```

### Download Failures

- Ensure yt-dlp is up to date: Set `SW_AUTO_UPDATE_YTDLP=true`
- Check FFmpeg is installed in the container
- Review download logs in the admin panel

### Offline Playback Not Working

- Ensure you cached the playlist while online
- Check that Service Worker is registered (Settings > PWA)
- Clear browser cache and re-cache the playlist

### Port Already in Use

Change the port in `docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
ports:
  - "YOUR_PORT:8888"
